# Software Architecture Exploration

**Focus Period:** February 2026

## Overview

This project builds upon SOLID and Clean Code principles to explore fundamental software architecture patterns and practices.

## Key Topics

- **Clean Architecture** - Organizing code around business rules with clear dependency rules
- **Onion Architecture** - Layered approach with domain at the core
- **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)** - Isolating application core from external concerns

## Goals

- Understand architectural patterns and their differences
- Apply layered architecture in a small practical project
- Implement dependency inversion at architectural level
